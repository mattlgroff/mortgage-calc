## Mortgage Affordability Calculator

Inspired by Ramsey's Florida Mortgage Calculator but the focus is keeping the total monthly payment under 25% of your monthly after-tax take-home pay.

It'll store your values in the browser's local storage so that when you return the last values you selected will still be there.

The defaults might seem strange because I used Florida as a reference which has much higher home insurance costs compared to the rest of the US.
